      <p class="text-success"><b>The Science City of Kolkata is the largest science centre in the Indian subcontinent. It is managed by National Council of Science Museums, Ministry of Culture, Government of India. It is located at the crossing of Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and J. B. S. Haldane Avenue in East Topsia. It is one of the most beautifully technical place I've ever seen. If you visit Calcutta and you do not visit the museum and the science city, you haven't seen anything at all. These is the most favorite place of mine in Kolkata. It's name doesn't justify how natural it looks. It has a huge perfectly carved bush garden, where you see differently unique ideas. And a beautiful aquarium which has everything starting from goldfishes, to human-eating piranas. It's a Calcutta's Must Visit!</b></p>

      <p class="text-success"><b>From the time I watched it. I never forgot a single part of it. It always cheers me up, whenever I see the baby moana meeting the ocean for the first time. And it's not only for kids. Anyone can watch it. And specially if you're in a hard part of your life, this'll either make up laugh or inspire you to try again. It's a perfect pick if you're finding a family night movie. And I bet that you would also love it as much as I do. Just take a chance, and watch it!</b></p>

      <p class="text-success"><b>I watched it like a million times, but still when it comes on tv, I get stuck to it. It's one of the most all-time favorite for many Disney lovers! There is no one in this world who could've watched it and not like it. It's a heart-warming and hilariously romantic movie, considering the second portion. If you have your dad at home on Sunday afternoon, instead of eating his head for parks, invite him to watch this movie with you. It doesn't only teaches you great life lessons but also the importance to taking your responsibilities, including the part when to chill down for a moment and enjoy your life with Timon and Pumba! Go on and watch this family live-action movie, now!!!</b></p>
